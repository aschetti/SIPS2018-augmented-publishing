# Augmented Publishing - A Proof of Concept

Lightning talk at the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science ([SIPS](https://www.improvingpsych.org/)), Aug. 24-26 2018, Grand Rapids, MI (U.S.A.). [Ian Hussey](https://github.com/ianhussey) and I describe our vision for a unified platform that includes research materials and interactive forms of scientific communication, which we refer to as _**"Augmented Academic Publishing"**_.

The working prototype (in *.html*) can be found [here](https://asch3tti.netlify.com/slides/sips2018/augmentedpublishing). Source code available [here](https://github.com/aschetti/augmented-publishing-SIPS2018/blob/master/AugmentedPublishing.Rmd).
